Project title:
	Fitness and Nutrition tracking and planning app

Problem I aim to tackle: 
	I aim to create an app that allows users to both track and plan their nutrition, as well as track and plan their exercise. The main purpose of this app is to combine these to planning and tracking needs into a single app. Many apps exist to do either of these two things but no one app does both, with a satisfactory level of depth. In short, the problem I aim to tackle is the problem of having too many apps to that can track either just nutrition or just exercise and I aim to solve it by designing an app that does both.

Why is this important to tackle?:
	This problem is important to tackle because fitness and nutrition are very intertwined and an app that deals with both extensively doesn’t exist yet. There is great potential for interaction between calorie intake and exercise tracking that can only be realized in a combined single app format. Features such as automatic daily caloric limit calculations that can be done based off a user’s height, weight, and age can now be more accurately calculated taking the amount of exercise a user gets into account. Another more ambitious, yet exciting feature could be for the app to recommend a diet and exercise plan for optimal fitness to a user.


Who stands to benefit?:
	The people who stand to benefit the most are those who either already track their workouts and nutrition but don’t have a central and convenient way of doing both, as well as those who are looking to start tracking their nutrition and workouts. In other words, the main market is people who are healthy and want to stay that way, or people who want to become healthy

List other apps:
1.	My Fitness Pal
2.	Loose it!
3.	My Workout Plan

Ways lacking:
1.	My Fitness Pal: Lacking good workout tracking, most features locked behind expensive paywall
2.	Loose it!: Very poor exercise planning and tracking, paywall for nutrition tracking features
3.	No nutrition tracking capabilities 
Addressing short comings:
1.	I plan to implement good workout/exercise tracking as well as implementing features that are locked behind the pay wall such as specific nutrient tracking
2.	I plan to do the same thing as the listed above to address the short comings of this app
3.	I plan to implement good nutrition tracking to address this problem.

Elevator Pitch:
	For my app I plan to take the best features from both nutrition tracking apps and work out tracking apps and combine them into one intuitive and convenient app. Users will be able to address their health and work out tracking and planning needs with one simple app instead of using multiple different apps like is required right now. There is great potential for interaction between the two tracking options in the app that aren’t possible in any other app out there right now. Such as diet and exercise recommendations or more accurate caloric intake calculations.

Technologies being used:
	I am planning on using the complete USDA National nutrient database to help users track food. I plan on implementing a system for users to be able to scan the barcode of a food item and automatically log it with all nutrition info pre-entered. Although I may end up using a different API but it will accomplish the same goal in the end.

	I hope to be able to implement the Fitbit API for tracking user steps, and calorie burn. This feature is common in many other apps like this so I believe it would be a good feature to include in this app too. 

I would also like to use the wger Workout Manager API to help track workouts and calories burned by workouts.
