This is the term paper for Caleb Bergen

Abstract:
The success of any given app is determined by a few factors such as good code, 
effective UI, and an understanding of the market it exists in. An apps developer 
needs to have a good grip on what market they are breaking into in order to make 
an app that stands out. I attempted to follow this philosophy when developing my 
app by researching the fitness tracking app market before deciding on what to put 
in my app. The app has a three tabbed design with a tab for creating a workout 
routine, a tab for planning when to do workouts, and a profile to keep track of 
physical attributes. Overall, I developed my app with the intention of filling the 
gaps left by the other apps in the market.
