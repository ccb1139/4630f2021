My goal was to create an easy-to-use, lightweight app that allows users to create, 
track, and plan out their workouts. I decided I would use a simple three-tab bottom navigation 
bar design for my app. The first tab holds the workout routines tab, the second holds the routine 
calendar view, and final the third tab holds the profile tab. My app is meant to be pure and lightweight, 
which means that there is no bulk or unneeded features. The three-tab approach allows for 
that. I allow users to fit create routines and add or remove the features within them. Then they can
assign a routine to a day of the week. There is also a profile tab that holds a user's name, weight,
and age so users can track their progress. I think that this approach is best because when I believe
that when someone wants a workout tracking app they want it to be fast and bloat-free.
